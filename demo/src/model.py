"""EVOLVABLE: the NumPyro model.

Contract (checks/contract.md):
- model(X, lo=None, hi=None): when lo/hi are given, add the likelihood of each isolate's log2-MIC interval and
  record it pointwise as numpyro.deterministic("log_lik", ...) with shape (n,).
- simulate(samples, X, key) -> array (draws, n): latent log2 MICs for the rows of X, from posterior samples.
- FEATURE_EFFECTS: name of the per-feature effect site (for the parsimony count), or None.

Baseline: log2 MIC ~ Normal(alpha + X beta, sigma), interval-censored, independent Normal(0, 2) priors on the
effects (skill: censored-mic-regression).

    # posterior mean 6.8 with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, which is the whole width of a ten-doubling grid). A
    # half-normal prior truncates that tail gently rather than hard: it is the weakly informative default for a
    # scale (Gelman et al., BDA3 ch. 21), and its log density is quadratic in s, so it leaves the bulk of the
    # posterior - where the 354 on-grid isolates do constrain s - untouched while removing the part of the tail
    # the censored rows cannot speak to. The champion's own error *distribution* change (logistic errors) was

    # posterior of the alleles that matter. A Student-t(4, 0, 2) prior has that width in the middle but
    # leaves the tail open, so the alleles that matter are barely regularised while the ~70 with no
    # fluoroquinolone mechanism stay shrunk. (A half-normal scale mixture was tried first and diverged;
    # see discarded/prior-width-4: the same gain came only when the width itself was raised.)
    # Twenty-second and final experiment on the rare-column axis, testing the one assumption every previous variant

    # the mechanism says to expect, since 15 carriers is ~12 per cross-validation fold, i.e. the point below which
    # a fold's fit cannot see the determinant at all and the coefficient it learns is pure prior. Move the

    # blaOXA-1 and the rest of the moderate-frequency housekeeping and efflux columns whose apparent effects the
    # stratified check showed to be QRDR background noise: uhpT_E350Q sits at -1.5 log2 units inside the
    # one-mutation stratum against a marginal correlation that is not significant) and keep the prior shape that
