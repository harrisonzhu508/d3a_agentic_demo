"""EVOLVABLE: the NumPyro model.

Contract (checks/contract.md):
- model(X, lo=None, hi=None): when lo/hi are given, add the likelihood of each isolate's log2-MIC interval and
  record it pointwise as numpyro.deterministic("log_lik", ...) with shape (n,).
- simulate(samples, X, key) -> array (draws, n): latent log2 MICs for the rows of X, from posterior samples.
- FEATURE_EFFECTS: name of the per-feature effect site (for the parsimony count), or None.

Baseline: log2 MIC ~ Normal(alpha + X beta, sigma), interval-censored, independent Normal(0, 2) priors on the
effects (skill: censored-mic-regression).

    # Logistic errors with the same variance as the baseline HalfNormal(2) errors: s = sigma sqrt(3/pi)
    # The error scale of the interval-censored likelihood is the parameter the censored rows identify least
    # well - a right-censored isolate is happy with almost any mu once mu is past the top of the plate, so what
    # pins s down is only the shape of the intervals, and its posterior is long-right-tailed (champion:
    # posterior mean 6.8 with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, which is the whole width of a ten-doubling grid). A
    # half-normal prior truncates that tail gently rather than hard: it is the weakly informative default for a
    # scale (Gelman et al., BDA3 ch. 21), and its log density is quadratic in s, so it leaves the bulk of the
    # posterior - where the 354 on-grid isolates do constrain s - untouched while removing the part of the tail
    # the censored rows cannot speak to. The champion's own error *distribution* change (logistic errors) was
    # worth +340 ELPD, so getting the residual right is where the loss still lives: coverage is 82.6% against a
    # nominal 90%.
    # Thirty-fifth experiment, continuing on the one parameter this session has found still worth ELPD. The error
    # scale has now been measured twice against the champion's HalfNormal(2), both times clean (0 divergences, R-hat
    # under 1.009, 13 s) and both times positive at the best keep-ratio this session has seen: a half-Cauchy at 4
    # doublings, half the width of the dilution series, gains +4.55 +/- 2.41; at the champion's own scale of 2 it
    # gains +4.06 +/- 2.28. That the scale matters is a structural fact about this likelihood, not a coincidence: a
    # right-censored row contributes 1 - Phi((hi - mu)/s), flat in mu once mu is past hi + 3s, so the 204 isolates
    # above the top of the plate - 56% of the cross-validated loss - carry information about s and almost none about
    # mu. That the *family* barely matters (4 vs 2 doublings of half-Cauchy differ by 0.5 ELPD out of a 2.4 SE, and
    # 4 vs 2 of half-normal differed by +0.60) says the gain is the Cauchy's tail rather than its location: the
    # posterior mean sits at 6.8 doublings with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, and a half-normal's log density is
    # quadratic in s, which truncates that interval from above. The remaining unknown is the one that decides
    # whether this axis has anything left: is the gain the heaviness of the tail or merely the absence of the
    # Gaussian penalty? Gamma(2, 0.5) has mean 4 - the centre of the measured posterior - a mode at 2, and a log
    # density that is linear-plus-log in s, so it decays like exp(-s/2): much *wider* than the half-normal at the
    # posterior mode (density ratio 2.7x at s = 6.8) but genuinely light above 12, where the half-Cauchy leaves the
    # door open. If the gain survives, what the censored rows wanted was room around the mode and the axis is done;
    # if it collapses, they wanted the upper tail, and a proper heavy-tailed family (a scale-mixture t, or an
    # inverse-gamma) is where the remaining density is.

    # The champion needs very large effects on a few QRDR alleles (gyrA D87N ~ +11, parC S80I ~ +9 log2
    # units) - the MIC really does leave the plate for those isolates - so width 2 is already close to the
    # posterior of the alleles that matter. A Student-t(4, 0, 2) prior has that width in the middle but
    # leaves the tail open, so the alleles that matter are barely regularised while the ~70 with no
    # fluoroquinolone mechanism stay shrunk. (A half-normal scale mixture was tried first and diverged;
    # see discarded/prior-width-4: the same gain came only when the width itself was raised.)
    # Sixty-second experiment: the rare-column prior at the point the two failure modes agree on. Width 8 on the 14
    # columns carried by at most 15 isolates, on the wider-residual fit, has now been run three ways and each run
    # localises a different defect: no bound at 1000 draws gained +6.75 with 7 divergences; the soft cut at 16
    # doublings at 4000 draws and target_accept 0.98 lost a third of the gain (+4.24) and still diverged twice, which
    # says the cut is doing model work, not sampler work, and that the trajectories are escaping before the cut is
    # reached; and the neighbouring width 3, which needs no machinery at all, gained +2.72 +/- 2.23 with zero
    # divergences, R-hat 1.0067 and ESS 1116 - the best-resolved measurement on the axis (ratio 1.22) and the
    # smallest prize. Divergences in this prior are not a step-size problem, since the settings that fixed every
    # earlier variant (0.98, four times the draws, a dense mass matrix) made this one worse; they are the near-
    # unidentified ridge of a coefficient whose determinant four fifths of a fold cannot see, and a t(4) body at
    # width 8 lets a chain walk that ridge for tens of doublings before the density turns around. The fix is the one
    # the harness's own geometry suggests rather than one more knob: keep the wide prior where the data are silent
    # and shorten the part that the silent columns do not need, namely the far tail, with the cut at 12 doublings
    # instead of 16. Twelve is the plate's own width - a coefficient past it changes an MIC by more than the whole
    # dilution series, which for a determinant carried by three isolates is a claim the assay cannot support - and it
    # is a soft penalty (one log unit per softplus of |beta| beyond it), so a chain that reaches it is slowed, not
    # stopped, and the posterior is continuous. At the previous champion the analogous cut at 8 doublings cost
    # R-hat 1.015 and the cut at 24 produced a divergence, so 12 sits between the two measured failure points and
    # has not been tried.
