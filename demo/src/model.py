"""EVOLVABLE: the NumPyro model.

Contract (checks/contract.md):
- model(X, lo=None, hi=None): when lo/hi are given, add the likelihood of each isolate's log2-MIC interval and
  record it pointwise as numpyro.deterministic("log_lik", ...) with shape (n,).
- simulate(samples, X, key) -> array (draws, n): latent log2 MICs for the rows of X, from posterior samples.
- FEATURE_EFFECTS: name of the per-feature effect site (for the parsimony count), or None.

Baseline: log2 MIC ~ Normal(alpha + X beta, sigma), interval-censored, independent Normal(0, 2) priors on the
effects (skill: censored-mic-regression).

    # pins s down is only the shape of the intervals, and its posterior is long-right-tailed (champion:
    # posterior mean 6.8 with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, which is the whole width of a ten-doubling grid). A
    # half-normal prior truncates that tail gently rather than hard: it is the weakly informative default for a
    # scale (Gelman et al., BDA3 ch. 21), and its log density is quadratic in s, so it leaves the bulk of the
    # posterior - where the 354 on-grid isolates do constrain s - untouched while removing the part of the tail
    # the censored rows cannot speak to. The champion's own error *distribution* change (logistic errors) was
    # worth +340 ELPD, so getting the residual right is where the loss still lives: coverage is 82.6% against a
    # nominal 90%.

    # The champion needs very large effects on a few QRDR alleles (gyrA D87N ~ +11, parC S80I ~ +9 log2
    # units) - the MIC really does leave the plate for those isolates - so width 2 is already close to the
    # posterior of the alleles that matter. A Student-t(4, 0, 2) prior has that width in the middle but
    # leaves the tail open, so the alleles that matter are barely regularised while the ~70 with no
    # fluoroquinolone mechanism stay shrunk. (A half-normal scale mixture was tried first and diverged;
    # see discarded/prior-width-4: the same gain came only when the width itself was raised.)
    # Ninth attempt at the rare-column slab. The control experiment settled what the problem is: splitting the
    # effect site into two StudentT(4, 0, 2) groups with a where() mask - a prior identical to the champion's for
    # every column - samples cleanly (0 divergences) and gains 2.4 +/- 2.26 ELPD, so neither the split nor the
    # mask is what diverged. What diverged was width: a wide t on a column that carries almost no information has
    # a posterior as heavy-tailed as its prior, and NUTS cannot keep a trajectory inside it (the wide variants left
    # 4-245 divergences, the champion's width 2 leaves none, and a continuous width at 10 left 37). So narrow it
    # further than the champion rather than widening it: t(2, 0, 2) on columns carried by 15 isolates or fewer.
    # Same width, much shorter reach - the density of a t(2) falls off as 1/b^2 against a t(4)'s 1/b^4 in the tail
    # integral sense, so a coefficient at 10 doublings costs 12 log units instead of 4, while within +/- 2 the two
    # priors are indistinguishable (t(2) and t(4) both sit inside 3% of a Normal(0,2) density at b = 1). This is
    # the shrinkage the earlier variants bought with a sampled scale, obtained from the exponent alone, which is a
