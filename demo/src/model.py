- simulate(samples, X, key) -> array (draws, n): latent log2 MICs for the rows of X, from posterior samples.

    # Logistic errors with the same variance as the baseline HalfNormal(2) errors: s = sigma sqrt(3/pi)
    # The error scale of the interval-censored likelihood is the parameter the censored rows identify least
    # well - a right-censored isolate is happy with almost any mu once mu is past the top of the plate, so what
    # pins s down is only the shape of the intervals, and its posterior is long-right-tailed (champion:
    # posterior mean 6.8 with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, which is the whole width of a ten-doubling grid). A
    # half-normal prior truncates that tail gently rather than hard: it is the weakly informative default for a
    # scale (Gelman et al., BDA3 ch. 21), and its log density is quadratic in s, so it leaves the bulk of the
    # posterior - where the 354 on-grid isolates do constrain s - untouched while removing the part of the tail
    # the censored rows cannot speak to. The champion's own error *distribution* change (logistic errors) was
    # worth +340 ELPD, so getting the residual right is where the loss still lives: coverage is 82.6% against a
    # nominal 90%.
    # Thirty-fifth experiment, continuing on the one parameter this session has found still worth ELPD. The error
    # scale has now been measured twice against the champion's HalfNormal(2), both times clean (0 divergences, R-hat
    # under 1.009, 13 s) and both times positive at the best keep-ratio this session has seen: a half-Cauchy at 4
    # doublings, half the width of the dilution series, gains +4.55 +/- 2.41; at the champion's own scale of 2 it
    # gains +4.06 +/- 2.28. That the scale matters is a structural fact about this likelihood, not a coincidence: a
    # right-censored row contributes 1 - Phi((hi - mu)/s), flat in mu once mu is past hi + 3s, so the 204 isolates
    # above the top of the plate - 56% of the cross-validated loss - carry information about s and almost none about
    # mu. That the *family* barely matters (4 vs 2 doublings of half-Cauchy differ by 0.5 ELPD out of a 2.4 SE, and
    # 4 vs 2 of half-normal differed by +0.60) says the gain is the Cauchy's tail rather than its location: the
    # posterior mean sits at 6.8 doublings with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, and a half-normal's log density is
    # quadratic in s, which truncates that interval from above. The remaining unknown is the one that decides
    # whether this axis has anything left: is the gain the heaviness of the tail or merely the absence of the
    # Gaussian penalty? Gamma(2, 0.5) has mean 4 - the centre of the measured posterior - a mode at 2, and a log
    # density that is linear-plus-log in s, so it decays like exp(-s/2): much *wider* than the half-normal at the
    # posterior mode (density ratio 2.7x at s = 6.8) but genuinely light above 12, where the half-Cauchy leaves the
    # door open. If the gain survives, what the censored rows wanted was room around the mode and the axis is done;
    # if it collapses, they wanted the upper tail, and a proper heavy-tailed family (a scale-mixture t, or an
    # inverse-gamma) is where the remaining density is.
    # Forty-first experiment: the shape axis, completed by the one family that has the mode the data show. Four
    # priors on the same scale parameter are now measured against the same champion and folds, all with clean gates,
    # identical agreement (78.1%) and coverage (82%), differing only in ELPD:
    #     HalfNormal(2)            champion by construction                    0
    #     Gamma(0.5, 0.125)  mean 4, mode 0     flat-ish above the mode   +0.89 +/- 0.50
    #     Gamma(2, 0.5)      mean 4, mode 2     as above, more mass low   +3.98 +/- 1.97  (kept)
    #     Gamma(3, 0.75)     mean 4, mode 2.7   firmer above 16           -0.22 +/- 0.40  (and R-hat 1.013)
    # The shape sequence rises from 0.5 to 2 and falls by 3, so the pressure the prior puts on the upper tail has an
    # interior optimum - but the gamma family is *unimodal at a small scale* in all four cases, whereas the posterior
    # the data produce is not: the kept fit has posterior mean 9.2 doublings with a 97.5% point of 13.1 and the
    # half-Cauchy variants (mode at 0, no mode at all) scored +4.55 and +4.06, the two highest of the session. That
    # is a consistent story rather than noise: what the 204 right-censored rows are arguing for is a large scale, and
    # every prior whose mode sits at 0-3 doublings makes them pay to get one, the half-normal most of all. So test
    # the opposite directly - a prior whose mode is at the posterior the data reach. Inverse-gamma(nu/2, nu*s0^2/2)
    # with nu = 4 and s0 = 8 doublings has median 7.7, mode 5.7 and a heavy (s^-5) upper tail; its log density is
    # -4.4 nats at s = 2 and -3.1 at s = 1 relative to the mode, against the gamma's -2.7 and -1.2, i.e. it *is* a
    # half-Cauchy in the upper tail (where the censored rows live) and an inverse power below (where no row can
    # inform s, since a scale near zero is excluded by the 98 on-grid isolates anyway). If the +4 came from removing
    # upward pressure, this keeps it and should exceed it; if it came from having mass near 2, it loses.

    # posterior of the alleles that matter. A Student-t(4, 0, 2) prior has that width in the middle but
