    # Logistic errors with the same variance as the baseline HalfNormal(2) errors: s = sigma sqrt(3/pi)
    # The error scale of the interval-censored likelihood is the parameter the censored rows identify least
    # well - a right-censored isolate is happy with almost any mu once mu is past the top of the plate, so what
    # pins s down is only the shape of the intervals, and its posterior is long-right-tailed (champion:
    # posterior mean 6.8 with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, which is the whole width of a ten-doubling grid). A
    # half-normal prior truncates that tail gently rather than hard: it is the weakly informative default for a
    # scale (Gelman et al., BDA3 ch. 21), and its log density is quadratic in s, so it leaves the bulk of the
    # posterior - where the 354 on-grid isolates do constrain s - untouched while removing the part of the tail
    # the censored rows cannot speak to. The champion's own error *distribution* change (logistic errors) was
    # worth +340 ELPD, so getting the residual right is where the loss still lives: coverage is 82.6% against a
    # nominal 90%.
    # Thirty-fifth experiment, continuing on the one parameter this session has found still worth ELPD. The error
    # scale has now been measured twice against the champion's HalfNormal(2), both times clean (0 divergences, R-hat
    # under 1.009, 13 s) and both times positive at the best keep-ratio this session has seen: a half-Cauchy at 4
    # doublings, half the width of the dilution series, gains +4.55 +/- 2.41; at the champion's own scale of 2 it
    # gains +4.06 +/- 2.28. That the scale matters is a structural fact about this likelihood, not a coincidence: a
    # right-censored row contributes 1 - Phi((hi - mu)/s), flat in mu once mu is past hi + 3s, so the 204 isolates
    # above the top of the plate - 56% of the cross-validated loss - carry information about s and almost none about
    # mu. That the *family* barely matters (4 vs 2 doublings of half-Cauchy differ by 0.5 ELPD out of a 2.4 SE, and
    # 4 vs 2 of half-normal differed by +0.60) says the gain is the Cauchy's tail rather than its location: the
    # posterior mean sits at 6.8 doublings with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, and a half-normal's log density is
    # quadratic in s, which truncates that interval from above. The remaining unknown is the one that decides
    # whether this axis has anything left: is the gain the heaviness of the tail or merely the absence of the
    # Gaussian penalty? Gamma(2, 0.5) has mean 4 - the centre of the measured posterior - a mode at 2, and a log
    # density that is linear-plus-log in s, so it decays like exp(-s/2): much *wider* than the half-normal at the
    # posterior mode (density ratio 2.7x at s = 6.8) but genuinely light above 12, where the half-Cauchy leaves the
    # door open. If the gain survives, what the censored rows wanted was room around the mode and the axis is done;
    # if it collapses, they wanted the upper tail, and a proper heavy-tailed family (a scale-mixture t, or an
    # inverse-gamma) is where the remaining density is.
    # Sixty-sixth experiment: the combination, with the prior settings the combination's own diagnostics asked for,
    # and nothing else. An InvGamma(2, 128) residual scale (mode 5.7 doublings, median 7.7, an s^-5 tail, written on
    # the reciprocal since numpyro has no inverse-gamma) with t(4, 0, 8) on the 14 rare columns produced the largest
    # gain of the session twice over - +8.28 at default settings (R-hat 1.0122, zero divergences, ESS 1351) and, when
    # I gave it the sampler that R-hat seemed to call for, +3.28 with R-hat 1.5541, ESS 18 and a 221 s run. Reading
    # those two runs together is the whole of this experiment. A pair of near-flat directions in the posterior is
    # either a ridge, where the chains diffuse and more steps help, or a funnel, where the density pinches and more
    # steps make it worse: the signature of the second is that a tighter step and a mass matrix that mixes all
    # parameters together turn a 1.012 into a 1.55, and that is what happened, so the obstruction is the geometry of
    # the priors meeting, not the number of steps. The two priors are not independent the way two hypotheses on
    # separate axes are. The wide rare-column prior supplies the fit with effects that can move an isolate's mu by
    # more than the plate; the inverse-gamma supplies it with a residual that makes such a move cheap; where both
    # slacken at once, the model has two ways of saying "this isolate is resistant" for the price of one, and the
    # posterior of each depends on how far the other has gone - which is a funnel in (scale, beta_rare), not a ridge.
    # So the fix is in the prior that has the adjustable part. The rare-column tail is cut at 16 doublings rather
    # than 12, which is where the same t(4, 0, 8) prior converged by itself at both residual scales this session
    # (uncut: 7 divergences at the narrow fit, and the cut at 12 costing a fifth of the gain at the wider one; cut at
    # 16 at the old champion: zero divergences, +3.37, R-hat 1.003 at 3000 draws), and the scale keeps the
    # distribution that has measured +6.1 to +6.6 five times with the tightest gates of any change on the table. If
    # the combination still will not converge at the settings the parts converge at, then the two slacks are one
    # degree of freedom expressed twice - which the 84% additivity of the last pair had already hinted at - and the
    # session's conclusion is the single InvGamma, +6.43 +/- 3.56, ratio 1.81, which is as close to the harness's rule
    # as anything has come and is where this loop should stop.
    # One hundred and eighteenth experiment: the combination the loop's own procedure asks for at the third attempt,
    # built from the two changes whose errors are the smallest and whose mechanism is the one the whole session has
    # been circling. Six runs now measure the prior width on the 63 columns the plate can resolve, and they are
    # monotone in width with errors that never once fell below half the gain they bracketed: width 1 costs 0.49 +/-
    # 1.69, the kept width 2 is main, width 2.5 gains 0.26 +/- 0.70 - the point a quarter-step was predicted to be
    # worth, arriving within two hundredths of the half-an-ELPD-per-doubling line - width 4 gains 1.24 +/- 1.95 for
    # -141.05, and width 8 gains 2.68 +/- 3.66 for -139.61. Eleven runs measure the residual scale and conclude that
    # the parameter is not identified: location steps of twenty per cent move the score by a tenth of an ELPD, a
    # half-step in the prior's median reaches -142.17 and loses only its R-hat, and the posterior median of the scale
    # itself answers 6.9, 9.2, 11.2, 15.6, 33.0 or 82.1 doublings depending on which prior is asked. Both curves are
    # real and both are below the harness's resolution one step at a time, which is the sentence the report has to
    # carry; what has not been tried is what the procedure says to do when two hypotheses each gain more than half
    # their error and neither clears twice it, which is to combine them. The combination is not a sum of slacks and
    # that is the point of running it. Widening the effect prior buys density on the 204 right-censored rows by moving
    # their mu above the top well; loosening the residual buys the same density by admitting the intervals are wide.
    # Measured separately they are the same trade, and the champion's keep of +9.19 for two priors loosened together
    # against +6.4 for either alone said so at the time. Measured together they are a fit that does not need either
    # lever to be extreme, which is what a posterior whose geometry is a funnel looks like from the outside: the two
    # parameters trade along a ridge and the sampler's error grows along it, so the paired standard error - the
    # disagreement between two fits over 558 isolates - grows faster than the gain. A width of 3 on the resolved block
    # is half of the step that reached -141.05, a scale rate of 200 is the largest loosening of the residual that this
    # session has seen keep its divergences at zero and put its prior median at nineteen doublings rather than seven
    # and a half, and the pair should land near the best single runs of either axis, around +1, at an error that a
    # single lever at the same distance cannot reach because the two of them disagree about different isolates. If it
    # keeps, the loop's fifty-refused streak is a statement about single steps in a two-parameter trade and the
    # report says that. If it comes back flat with clean gates, then the ridge is not a trade but a plateau, and the
    # conclusion the last thirty runs have been walking towards is the one to write down.
