"""EVOLVABLE: the NumPyro model.

Contract (checks/contract.md):
- model(X, lo=None, hi=None): when lo/hi are given, add the likelihood of each isolate's log2-MIC interval and
  record it pointwise as numpyro.deterministic("log_lik", ...) with shape (n,).
- simulate(samples, X, key) -> array (draws, n): latent log2 MICs for the rows of X, from posterior samples.
- FEATURE_EFFECTS: name of the per-feature effect site (for the parsimony count), or None.

Baseline: log2 MIC ~ Normal(alpha + X beta, sigma), interval-censored, independent Normal(0, 2) priors on the
effects (skill: censored-mic-regression).

    # posterior mean 6.8 with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, which is the whole width of a ten-doubling grid). A
    # half-normal prior truncates that tail gently rather than hard: it is the weakly informative default for a
    # scale (Gelman et al., BDA3 ch. 21), and its log density is quadratic in s, so it leaves the bulk of the
    # posterior - where the 354 on-grid isolates do constrain s - untouched while removing the part of the tail
    # the censored rows cannot speak to. The champion's own error *distribution* change (logistic errors) was
    # worth +340 ELPD, so getting the residual right is where the loss still lives: coverage is 82.6% against a

    # units) - the MIC really does leave the plate for those isolates - so width 2 is already close to the
    # posterior of the alleles that matter. A Student-t(4, 0, 2) prior has that width in the middle but
    # leaves the tail open, so the alleles that matter are barely regularised while the ~70 with no
    # fluoroquinolone mechanism stay shrunk. (A half-normal scale mixture was tried first and diverged;
    # see discarded/prior-width-4: the same gain came only when the width itself was raised.)
    # Twenty-seventh experiment: the last measurement on the rare-column prior, chosen because the two branches of
    # the argument now make opposite predictions at one point. With the threshold at 15 carriers and the cut at 16
    # doublings, width has been measured at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 (gains +1.9 to +2.4, +2.79, +3.09, +3.51, +3.37, with
    # paired SEs 2.25, 2.72, 3.48, 4.05, 5.11). The point estimates rise to about 5 and then stop; the SEs rise
    # throughout, so the keep-ratio falls monotonically from 1.06 - and the +1.90/+2.40/+2.79 triple, all three from
    # priors that are literally the champion's, says about +2 of that band is the harness's floor. Reading A is
    # therefore that the axis is unidentified and closed. Reading B is that the gain curve is real but shallow and
    # the SE growth is what kills it, in which case the optimum under the harness's rule is the largest gain divided
    # by its SE and it sits between the two measured points, at width 5 the ratio is 0.87 and at width 8 it is 0.66
    # while the estimate is flat - so nothing between them can beat 0.89 either, and the only untested region that
    # could is between 5 and 8 where the estimate is at its maximum and the SE has not yet reached 5. Width 6 is
    # that point: if the ratio rises above the 0.89 measured at width 4, reading B holds and the axis has an
    # optimum to argue about; if it continues down towards 0.8, the SE is purely a function of the width and reading
    # A is correct - the rare columns are unidentified, their prior cannot buy predictive density here, and the
    # loop should stop paying for it.
