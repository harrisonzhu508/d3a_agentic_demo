    # Logistic errors with the same variance as the baseline HalfNormal(2) errors: s = sigma sqrt(3/pi)
    # The error scale of the interval-censored likelihood is the parameter the censored rows identify least
    # well - a right-censored isolate is happy with almost any mu once mu is past the top of the plate, so what
    # pins s down is only the shape of the intervals, and its posterior is long-right-tailed (champion:
    # posterior mean 6.8 with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, which is the whole width of a ten-doubling grid). A
    # half-normal prior truncates that tail gently rather than hard: it is the weakly informative default for a
    # scale (Gelman et al., BDA3 ch. 21), and its log density is quadratic in s, so it leaves the bulk of the
    # posterior - where the 354 on-grid isolates do constrain s - untouched while removing the part of the tail
    # the censored rows cannot speak to. The champion's own error *distribution* change (logistic errors) was
    # worth +340 ELPD, so getting the residual right is where the loss still lives: coverage is 82.6% against a
    # nominal 90%.
    # Thirty-fifth experiment, continuing on the one parameter this session has found still worth ELPD. The error
    # scale has now been measured twice against the champion's HalfNormal(2), both times clean (0 divergences, R-hat
    # under 1.009, 13 s) and both times positive at the best keep-ratio this session has seen: a half-Cauchy at 4
    # doublings, half the width of the dilution series, gains +4.55 +/- 2.41; at the champion's own scale of 2 it
    # gains +4.06 +/- 2.28. That the scale matters is a structural fact about this likelihood, not a coincidence: a
    # right-censored row contributes 1 - Phi((hi - mu)/s), flat in mu once mu is past hi + 3s, so the 204 isolates
    # above the top of the plate - 56% of the cross-validated loss - carry information about s and almost none about
    # mu. That the *family* barely matters (4 vs 2 doublings of half-Cauchy differ by 0.5 ELPD out of a 2.4 SE, and
    # 4 vs 2 of half-normal differed by +0.60) says the gain is the Cauchy's tail rather than its location: the
    # posterior mean sits at 6.8 doublings with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, and a half-normal's log density is
    # quadratic in s, which truncates that interval from above. The remaining unknown is the one that decides
    # whether this axis has anything left: is the gain the heaviness of the tail or merely the absence of the
    # Gaussian penalty? Gamma(2, 0.5) has mean 4 - the centre of the measured posterior - a mode at 2, and a log
    # density that is linear-plus-log in s, so it decays like exp(-s/2): much *wider* than the half-normal at the
    # posterior mode (density ratio 2.7x at s = 6.8) but genuinely light above 12, where the half-Cauchy leaves the
    # door open. If the gain survives, what the censored rows wanted was room around the mode and the axis is done;
    # if it collapses, they wanted the upper tail, and a proper heavy-tailed family (a scale-mixture t, or an
    # inverse-gamma) is where the remaining density is.
    # Sixty-sixth experiment: the combination, with the prior settings the combination's own diagnostics asked for,
    # and nothing else. An InvGamma(2, 128) residual scale (mode 5.7 doublings, median 7.7, an s^-5 tail, written on
    # the reciprocal since numpyro has no inverse-gamma) with t(4, 0, 8) on the 14 rare columns produced the largest
    # gain of the session twice over - +8.28 at default settings (R-hat 1.0122, zero divergences, ESS 1351) and, when
    # I gave it the sampler that R-hat seemed to call for, +3.28 with R-hat 1.5541, ESS 18 and a 221 s run. Reading
    # those two runs together is the whole of this experiment. A pair of near-flat directions in the posterior is
    # either a ridge, where the chains diffuse and more steps help, or a funnel, where the density pinches and more
    # steps make it worse: the signature of the second is that a tighter step and a mass matrix that mixes all
    # parameters together turn a 1.012 into a 1.55, and that is what happened, so the obstruction is the geometry of
    # the priors meeting, not the number of steps. The two priors are not independent the way two hypotheses on
    # separate axes are. The wide rare-column prior supplies the fit with effects that can move an isolate's mu by
    # more than the plate; the inverse-gamma supplies it with a residual that makes such a move cheap; where both
    # slacken at once, the model has two ways of saying "this isolate is resistant" for the price of one, and the
    # posterior of each depends on how far the other has gone - which is a funnel in (scale, beta_rare), not a ridge.
    # So the fix is in the prior that has the adjustable part. The rare-column tail is cut at 16 doublings rather
    # than 12, which is where the same t(4, 0, 8) prior converged by itself at both residual scales this session
    # (uncut: 7 divergences at the narrow fit, and the cut at 12 costing a fifth of the gain at the wider one; cut at
    # 16 at the old champion: zero divergences, +3.37, R-hat 1.003 at 3000 draws), and the scale keeps the
    # distribution that has measured +6.1 to +6.6 five times with the tightest gates of any change on the table. If
    # the combination still will not converge at the settings the parts converge at, then the two slacks are one
    # degree of freedom expressed twice - which the 84% additivity of the last pair had already hinted at - and the
    # session's conclusion is the single InvGamma, +6.43 +/- 3.56, ratio 1.81, which is as close to the harness's rule
    # as anything has come and is where this loop should stop.

    # One hundred and twenty-ninth experiment: the term that bought the champion its +9.19, applied to the columns the
    # design has always left unb bound, at a height four doublings below the one that cost nineteen ELPD. The evidence
    # for a ceiling on the resolved block is a single measurement and it is enormous: put the same softplus penalty on
    # the 63 columns a fold can estimate, at the same knee of sixteen doublings where the rare block carries it, and the
    # fit loses 19.11 +/- 9.09 ELPD, the largest self-inflicted damage in this log, with coverage climbing to 93%
    # because the model has stopped trying to reach the censored rows. Twice more the loop tried a ceiling on those same
    # columns further out - at 32 doublings, where the penalty is flat to four decimal places over every draw the
    # champion produces - and got 2 divergences, -4.56 ELPD and an R-hat of 1.0084, and before that nothing at all
    # except refusals. What those runs say is not that ceilings are bad but that a ceiling a fit can feel on a column
    # the plate can resolve is a lie about an effect the data have measured, and the further the lie is pushed out, the
    # more the penalty term costs the chain in gradient noise while buying nothing. What has never been tried is a
    # ceiling between those two heights. Fourteen doublings is seven dilution steps, which is the whole of the
    # fluoroquinolone step from a wild-type Escherichia coli to a resistant one in this assay, and the champion's
    # resolved coefficients do not go near it: gyrA_S83L, the largest effect on the plate, sits at about five doublings
    # in the kept fit, parC_S80I near three, and the 63-column block's largest posterior median is under nine. So at the
    # values this fit occupies the softplus contributes log(1 + e^-2) = 0.127 per column and a gradient of 0.119 - not
    # the nothing of the 32-doubling version, which is what made that run's chains lose their way without moving the
    # score, but a quarter of the push the 16-doubling version delivered at the same coordinates. The prediction the
    # nineteen-ELPD run makes is therefore a scaled version of itself, and this is the one direction on this branch
    # where the loop has a measurement large enough to extrapolate from rather than a slope to interpolate: if the cost
    # of binding the resolved slopes is roughly proportional to how far above the fitted coefficients the bound sits,
    # fourteen doublings should cost a fifth to a tenth of nineteen, one to four ELPD, and should do it with the
    # divergences the 32-doubling version grew. If instead it comes back flat, then the 19.11 of the 16-doubling run
    # was not a bound on the fit but a bound on the funnel, and the term's whole destructive power lives in a region
    # narrower than two doublings, which would be the clearest evidence this session has produced that what the
    # champion is really modelling is not a resistance architecture but a geometry.
