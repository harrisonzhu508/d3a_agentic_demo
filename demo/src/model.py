    # Logistic errors with the same variance as the baseline HalfNormal(2) errors: s = sigma sqrt(3/pi)
    # The error scale of the interval-censored likelihood is the parameter the censored rows identify least
    # well - a right-censored isolate is happy with almost any mu once mu is past the top of the plate, so what
    # pins s down is only the shape of the intervals, and its posterior is long-right-tailed (champion:
    # posterior mean 6.8 with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, which is the whole width of a ten-doubling grid). A
    # half-normal prior truncates that tail gently rather than hard: it is the weakly informative default for a
    # scale (Gelman et al., BDA3 ch. 21), and its log density is quadratic in s, so it leaves the bulk of the
    # posterior - where the 354 on-grid isolates do constrain s - untouched while removing the part of the tail
    # the censored rows cannot speak to. The champion's own error *distribution* change (logistic errors) was
    # worth +340 ELPD, so getting the residual right is where the loss still lives: coverage is 82.6% against a
    # nominal 90%.
    # Thirty-fifth experiment, continuing on the one parameter this session has found still worth ELPD. The error
    # scale has now been measured twice against the champion's HalfNormal(2), both times clean (0 divergences, R-hat
    # under 1.009, 13 s) and both times positive at the best keep-ratio this session has seen: a half-Cauchy at 4
    # doublings, half the width of the dilution series, gains +4.55 +/- 2.41; at the champion's own scale of 2 it
    # gains +4.06 +/- 2.28. That the scale matters is a structural fact about this likelihood, not a coincidence: a
    # right-censored row contributes 1 - Phi((hi - mu)/s), flat in mu once mu is past hi + 3s, so the 204 isolates
    # above the top of the plate - 56% of the cross-validated loss - carry information about s and almost none about
    # mu. That the *family* barely matters (4 vs 2 doublings of half-Cauchy differ by 0.5 ELPD out of a 2.4 SE, and
    # 4 vs 2 of half-normal differed by +0.60) says the gain is the Cauchy's tail rather than its location: the
    # posterior mean sits at 6.8 doublings with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, and a half-normal's log density is
    # quadratic in s, which truncates that interval from above. The remaining unknown is the one that decides
    # whether this axis has anything left: is the gain the heaviness of the tail or merely the absence of the
    # Gaussian penalty? Gamma(2, 0.5) has mean 4 - the centre of the measured posterior - a mode at 2, and a log
    # density that is linear-plus-log in s, so it decays like exp(-s/2): much *wider* than the half-normal at the
    # posterior mode (density ratio 2.7x at s = 6.8) but genuinely light above 12, where the half-Cauchy leaves the
    # door open. If the gain survives, what the censored rows wanted was room around the mode and the axis is done;
    # if it collapses, they wanted the upper tail, and a proper heavy-tailed family (a scale-mixture t, or an
    # inverse-gamma) is where the remaining density is.
    # Sixty-sixth experiment: the combination, with the prior settings the combination's own diagnostics asked for,
    # and nothing else. An InvGamma(2, 128) residual scale (mode 5.7 doublings, median 7.7, an s^-5 tail, written on
    # the reciprocal since numpyro has no inverse-gamma) with t(4, 0, 8) on the 14 rare columns produced the largest
    # gain of the session twice over - +8.28 at default settings (R-hat 1.0122, zero divergences, ESS 1351) and, when
    # I gave it the sampler that R-hat seemed to call for, +3.28 with R-hat 1.5541, ESS 18 and a 221 s run. Reading
    # those two runs together is the whole of this experiment. A pair of near-flat directions in the posterior is
    # either a ridge, where the chains diffuse and more steps help, or a funnel, where the density pinches and more
    # steps make it worse: the signature of the second is that a tighter step and a mass matrix that mixes all
    # parameters together turn a 1.012 into a 1.55, and that is what happened, so the obstruction is the geometry of
    # the priors meeting, not the number of steps. The two priors are not independent the way two hypotheses on
    # separate axes are. The wide rare-column prior supplies the fit with effects that can move an isolate's mu by
    # more than the plate; the inverse-gamma supplies it with a residual that makes such a move cheap; where both
    # slacken at once, the model has two ways of saying "this isolate is resistant" for the price of one, and the
    # posterior of each depends on how far the other has gone - which is a funnel in (scale, beta_rare), not a ridge.
    # So the fix is in the prior that has the adjustable part. The rare-column tail is cut at 16 doublings rather
    # than 12, which is where the same t(4, 0, 8) prior converged by itself at both residual scales this session
    # (uncut: 7 divergences at the narrow fit, and the cut at 12 costing a fifth of the gain at the wider one; cut at
    # 16 at the old champion: zero divergences, +3.37, R-hat 1.003 at 3000 draws), and the scale keeps the
    # distribution that has measured +6.1 to +6.6 five times with the tightest gates of any change on the table. If
    # the combination still will not converge at the settings the parts converge at, then the two slacks are one
    # degree of freedom expressed twice - which the 84% additivity of the last pair had already hinted at - and the
    # session's conclusion is the single InvGamma, +6.43 +/- 3.56, ratio 1.81, which is as close to the harness's rule
    # as anything has come and is where this loop should stop.

    # and gamma priors put it at 6.9 and 9.2 doublings, the kept inverse-gamma at 16.1, a shape of 2.5 at the same
    # mean at 34.0, and a shape of 4 - which cuts the far tail from s^-5 to s^-9, that is, which forbids enormous
    # scales - at 84.6 with a 90% interval of [58.5, 119.6]. Read in order of tail weight the posterior scale is
    # monotonically increasing in how hard the prior tries to stop it, which is not what a well-posed parameter
    # looks like and is exactly what a likelihood does when a parameter is doing a job nothing else in the model can
    # do. That job is identified: 204 isolates are right-censored above the plate and the held-out censored
    # log-density of the interval, 1 - Phi((hi - mu)/s), rises without bound as s grows once mu is past the top, so
    # the residual scale is being used to buy density on rows whose MIC was never measured, and it will buy as much
    # as any prior lets it. What the tail of an inverse-gamma was doing was not expressing uncertainty about the
    # assay's repeatability - a fit that ends at 16 doublings, against a microdilution reading repeatable to about
    # half a doubling, is not uncertain about anything, it is exploiting a one-sided likelihood - but deciding how
    # far the exploitation runs before the prior's density runs out, which is why pushing the tail inward pushed the
    # answer outward. The fix the geometry asks for is a prior whose log density decays faster than any power of s,
    # so that the reward of a larger s is eventually outrun: log s ~ Normal(log 9.2, 1), the geometric mean of the
    # fit that preceded the inverse-gamma family and an interval that spans 3.4 to 25 doublings at 95%, meaning a
    # statement as permissive as anything tried here, expressed on the log scale where a scale parameter actually
    # lives. If the fit lands near 9 rather than 16 or 85, then this axis has one runaway direction and a
    # light-tailed family is the correct statement of what the model does not know; if it lands at 16 again, then
    # even a log-normal is too thin at the top and the loop must conclude that the residual scale on these data has
    # no posterior at all, that the -142.29 on main is one point on a plateau whose far end is unmeasured, and that
    # no metric the harness computes from held-out censored density will ever be the right way to choose it.
