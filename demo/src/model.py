"""EVOLVABLE: the NumPyro model.

Contract (checks/contract.md):
- model(X, lo=None, hi=None): when lo/hi are given, add the likelihood of each isolate's log2-MIC interval and
  record it pointwise as numpyro.deterministic("log_lik", ...) with shape (n,).
- simulate(samples, X, key) -> array (draws, n): latent log2 MICs for the rows of X, from posterior samples.
- FEATURE_EFFECTS: name of the per-feature effect site (for the parsimony count), or None.

Baseline: log2 MIC ~ Normal(alpha + X beta, sigma), interval-censored, independent Normal(0, 2) priors on the
effects (skill: censored-mic-regression).

    # posterior mean 6.8 with a 95% interval of 5.2-8.7, which is the whole width of a ten-doubling grid). A
    # half-normal prior truncates that tail gently rather than hard: it is the weakly informative default for a
    # scale (Gelman et al., BDA3 ch. 21), and its log density is quadratic in s, so it leaves the bulk of the
    # posterior - where the 354 on-grid isolates do constrain s - untouched while removing the part of the tail
    # the censored rows cannot speak to. The champion's own error *distribution* change (logistic errors) was
    # worth +340 ELPD, so getting the residual right is where the loss still lives: coverage is 82.6% against a
    # nominal 90%.

    # posterior of the alleles that matter. A Student-t(4, 0, 2) prior has that width in the middle but
    # leaves the tail open, so the alleles that matter are barely regularised while the ~70 with no
    # fluoroquinolone mechanism stay shrunk. (A half-normal scale mixture was tried first and diverged;
    # see discarded/prior-width-4: the same gain came only when the width itself was raised.)
    # Eighth attempt at the rare-column slab, after six parameterisations of beta_j = raw_j x scale_j (a product)
    # each gained 3-10 ELPD and each left 2-245 divergent transitions, in every case on the rare columns' own
    # scales - and a dense mass matrix made it worse (R-hat 1.07, ESS 47), which says the problem is a hard
    # curvature singularity at scale_j = 0 rather than a correlated ridge. Write the same prior with no product at
    # all: the rare columns get t(nu = 4, 0, 6) *directly*, whose log density is -5/2 log(1 + b_j^2/36) - so the
    # shrinkage is smooth in b_j and continues to grow logarithmically at infinity (a coefficient of 20 doublings
    # costs 5 log units, not the 50 a Normal would), while for the coefficients that matter the pull is negligible.
    # A Student-t *is* a scale mixture with the scale integrated out (Gelman et al., BDA3 ch. 5), which is what the
    # half-Cauchy slab was approximating by sampling the scale; integrating it analytically is the version with no
    # funnel. Width 6 rather than the champion's 2, because a rare column's leverage is sd 0.10-0.16 and a prior
    # narrower than four doublings of effect on mu is a prior of no-signal-by-assumption (what cost the 9.75 gain
